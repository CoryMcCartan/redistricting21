# Analysis Scripts

Each analysis is contained in a named folder. The `template/` folder contains
template scripts for each analysis. The `utils.R` script contains shared utility
scripts for data preparation and analysis, and also handles development imports
and template management. The `run.R` script handles running the whole analysis
and keeping components up-to-date.
