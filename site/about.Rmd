The 2021 redistricting cycle will be extremely consequential, setting legislative
and congressional boundaries for a decade, just as computing power and new data
allow map-drawers to create sophisticated partisan gerrymanders, and
the Supreme Court has stepped back from policing them.

We put together this site to analyze redistricting plans as states release them,
in context. In context means we will employ cutting-edge redistricting
simulation methodologies to create large numbers of alternative plans. This
helps make better judgement about the quality of a proposed or finalized plan,
by making comparisons to other plans which also respect municipal, state, and
federal requirements for redistricting.

We rely entirely on open source tools and data, so that anyone (with a bit of R
familiarity) can replicate the analysis and make changes to it.

We will attempt to cover as many state plans as we are able. This map summarizes
the state of our current analyses.
