# Data

As with our [post on the CO preliminary Congressional Districts](https://corymccartan.github.io/redistricting21/posts/2021-06-25-colorado-preliminary-congressional-districts/), we build our election data from the spatial electoral data that the Voting and Election Science Team creates. For the 2016 data, we average the presidential and senate races [@vest:16]. For the 2018 data, we average the Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State Elections [@vest:18]. And for the 2020 data, we average the presidential and senate races [@vest:20]. This provides a diverse set of races to use as baselines over time for evaluating the proposed plans.
