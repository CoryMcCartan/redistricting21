Washington was one of the first states to adopt a commission model for redistricting, in 1983, after decades of court battles. The commission consists of appointees from each of the majority and minority parties in the state House and Senate, along with one non-voting member. The commissioners must work out a redistricting plan, which may be amended by the legislature by a two-thirds vote. Democrats control the state legislature, but do not have a supermajority, making such amendments unlikely.\n2010 Congressional MapThe four proposed congressional districting plans are shown below. The two Democratic plans generally follow the contours of the 2010 map, while the Republican plans make more significant changes, especially to District 8 (Kim Schrier), which currently runs from the outer-ring Eastside suburbs across the Cascades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The four congressional districting plans.\n\n\n\nPolitical Features of Both Maps\nAs with all of our analyses, we compare these proposed plans with a large set of simulated plans, allowing us to understand how they differ from what might be reasonably expected.\nThese simulated plans follow Washington’s requirements of contiguity and compactness, and generally follow county lines. However, they do not take into account natural boundaries such as Puget Sound or the Cascade mountains, nor city or town boundaries. Additionally, they do not attempt to draw districts which look like the current districts. Staying closer to existing districts, and following geographic boundaries, may lead to qualitatively different districts with different partisan implications.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Democratic vote by district for the four plans and for 3,000 alternative plans. Learn more about this plot\n\n\n\nThe two Democratic plans create 7 safe Democratic seats, while the two Republican plans allow for only 6. The Republican House plan creates an even 5–5 split.\nIn comparison, the simulated plans align more with the Democratic plans, giving them 7 seats, on average, though with the 7th seat a bit more competitive.\nProportionality and Representativeness\nAll our plans are given two R.A. Plan Scores, one for proportionality—how close the seats distribution reflects the statewide vote—and one for representativeness—the odds that an average voter is represented by their preferred political party. The scores for Colorado are shown above. The graph below shows the proportionality and representativeness for all of our simulated redistricting plans, and the two proposed plans.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Proportionality and representativeness for the redistricting plans. Learn more about these measures\n\n\n\nThe Republican plans are quite proportional–giving them seats closer to their statewide vote share, on average, than would be otherwise expected. The Republican plans are also a bit more representative, though all four plans score well on this measure. This means the average voter is slightly more likely to be represented by a member of their preferred party under the Republican plans than under the Democratic plans.\nWhat would a good plan look like according to these two measures? The Republican House plan actually performs quite well, but has already been criticized as a gerrymander and is unlikely to be enacted. The two maps below are the simulated redistricting plan which scored the combined best on proportionality and representativeness. It has two safe Republican seats, one lean-Republican seat, four safe Democratic seats, and one competitive seat.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: The sampled plans with the best combination of proportionality and representativeness, with Democratic vote shares labelled.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Oregon gained one seat following the 2020 Census, raising its total seats to 6 for this decade. In Oregon, plans are proposed by the state legislature and signed by the governor as regular legislation. Currently, both the state legislature and governor’s office are controlled by Democrats.\n“Plan A” was released by the committees’ Democrats, and “Plan B” by the Republicans. Since Democrats control the legislative process, Plan A, or something like it, is significantly more likely to be enacted. Traditionally, however, redistricting in Oregon has been relatively bipartisan. The final enacted plan may differ significantly from both Plan A and Plan B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The preliminary congressional districting plans.\n\n\n\nOregon is dominated, demographically and politically, by the Portland metropolitan area. The state went 55% Democratic in 2016. This presents a challenge for Democratic map-drawers, who need to figure out a way to spread Democratic votes from Portland to the rest of the state, while preserving communities of interest and avoiding non-compact districts.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Population density and political patterns (2016 election) in Oregon.\n\n\n\nPolitical Features of the Proposed Maps\nAs with all of our analyses, we compare these proposed plans with a large set of simulated plans, allowing us to understand how they differ from what might be reasonably expected.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Democratic vote by district for the proposed plan and for 10,000 alternative plans. Learn more about this plot\n\n\n\nPlan A has a relatively safe 5D–1R split, which is more than the 4D–2R split that is most common from our set of simulations (with one seat from each party being competitive). The least-Democratic seat (numbered 2 on the figure below) is a particularly egregious departure from the set of simulated alternatives—no sampled plan came anywhere close to it. Plan B has a much safer Republican seat and 3 competitive seats that in a Republican-favoring year like 2016 could go Republican, leading to a 2D–4R split. Unsurprisingly, each plan favors the party that drew it.\nProportionality and Representativeness\nAll our plans are given two R.A. Plan Scores, one for proportionality—how close the seats distribution reflects the statewide vote—and one for representativeness—the odds that an average voter is represented by their preferred political party. The scores for Oregon are shown above.

The map below is the simulated redistricting plan which scored the combined best on proportionality and representativeness. It has two safe Republican seats, three safe Democratic seats, and one competitive seat.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: The sampled plan with the best combination of proportionality and representativeness, with Democratic vote shares labelled.\n\n\n\nLocating Goldilocks\nHow might we locate a compromise plan between these two? The two proposed plans are clearly very different. Quantifying the differences can be difficult for redistricting plans. We opt to use a variation of information metric. It is scaled so that a score of 0 indicates that the maps are completely different while a score of 1 indicates that the maps are identical. With those scores, we utilize a simple, but effective optimization method known as short bursts to traverse the information space between plans.\nBelow, we present 7 intermediate plans, which are approximately evenly spaced in information space between Plan A and Plan B.\n\n\n\nThe middle of these example plans has 3 expected safe Democratic seats, one safe expected Republican seat, and two expected competitive Republican-leaning seats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The preliminary congressional districting plan.\n\n\n\nOn June 23, Colorado’s brand-new independent redistricting commission released a preliminary redistricting plan for the state’s congressional districts. Due to its above-average population growth, Colorado has gained an additional congressional seat since the last time districts were drawn, in 2011.\nAlready, people on both sides of the aisle are less-than-thrilled with the proposed preliminary plans, citing concerns with district competitiveness. Some have suggested that the plan is slightly biased to favor Republicans, potentially making it easier for them to gain seats and recapture the House.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Partisan (2016 election) and demographic patterns in Colorado, with proposed districts overlaid.\n\n\n\nBut what constitutes a “fair” map in Colorado depends a lot on how different types of voters are distributed, where cities are, and more. What appears at first to be a slightly GOP-friendly plan could in fact be a plan that is good for Democrats, relative to what might otherwise be expected. In other words, to talk about the Colorado plan, it’s important to consider what the alternatives might be.\nWe’ll evaluate the Colorado plan by comparing it to 3,000 hypothetical other plans, which were drawn by a computer algorithm following the same rules that the independent commission has to follow.\nThe short evaluation is that, as the title suggests, the plan is generally fair, compared to sampled plans that meet similar criteria.\nGenerating Plans\nGenerating 3,000 hypothetical plans is not straightforward—there are vastly more ways to draw redistricting plans than there are atoms in the universe, and yet only a minuscule fraction of these plans satisfy all the relevant legal constraints. Here, we’ll use a new algorithm (McCartan and Imai 2020), which randomly generates plans according to a specific statistical distribution. Reflecting Colorado’s redistricting criteria, we ensure the generated plans:\nHave districts with equal populations (at most 0.1% away from full equality).\nHave geographically contiguous and compact districts.\nFollow county lines as much as possible.\nDon’t use any information on incumbents.\nIn line with the commission’s findings, we do not require the creation of a majority-minority district for compliance with the federal Voting Rights Act.\nHere are a few of the sampled plans:\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nOnce we’ve generated the set of comparison plans, we can use past election data to estimate how congressional elections might have turned out under each of these alternative plans. The results of this calculation are plotted in Figure 3 below, for the 2016 and 2018 elections. Each dot represents a district in a possible plan, with blue dots representing Democratic-controlled districts and red dots Republican-controlled districts, and the districts are arranged by how Democratic they are. The black lines show the estimated election results under the newly-proposed plan. When these lines are lower than their corresponding set of points, that indicates that the proposed district has fewer Democratic voters than would be expected under an average fair and neutral map.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Democratic vote by district for the proposed plan and 3,000 alternative plans.\n\n\n\nWhat we see overall is a proposed set of districts that is very much in line with what would be expected under a fair and neutral procedure. The only consistent difference is a lower number of Democratic voters in two Republican-leaning districts, which is offset by slightly higher number of Democratic voters in the most competitive district. This feature of the plan helps Democrats versus the counterfactual, which would lead to more reliable 4-4 splits.\nWe also look at what’s called a seats-votes curve, which shows the relationship between the share of votes that a party earns and the number of seats that it wins as a result. Ideally, these two numbers would track each other closely, but gerrymandering distorts this relationship to favor one party. Here, the seats-votes curve for the proposed plan sits looks to be about average for the seats-votes curves of the comparison plans. That is indicative of a map that was drawn without strongly considering one party over the other.\n\nAll seats-votes curves are somewhat approximate, as they must relate between the number of seats, which here is only 8, and the number of votes, which is orders of magnitude larger. This inevitably leads to discreteness, which here is somewhat suppressed through the use of linear interpolation.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Democratic seats versus votes across two elections. Actual map shown in blue.\n\n\n\nAnother common way to measure the partisan bias of a plan is the “mean-median difference,” which compares the mean and median districts according to their Democratic vote shares. As the figure below shows, the proposed plan slightly favors Republicans according to this measure, but less than would actually be expected according to the neutral comparison plans. This discrepancy reflects structural bias against Democrats, who tend to cluster in cities where their votes are disproportionately wasted.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Mean-median bias for the proposed plan and 3,000 alternative plans.\n\n\n\nAll three partisan bias measures point to the same conclusion: the Commission’s proposed congressional district map is in line with other fair and neutral plans that could have been drawn, and, if anything, slightly favors Democrats.\nData\nSince the Commission provides population estimates at the 2010 block level, we start by building a block dataset using geomander (Kenny 2021). This has the shapes for each block along with the population and voting age populations by block.\nGenerally, we use a different definition of populations from what Colorado provides. We often treat race and ethnicity as one variable. However, Colorado’s preliminary data follows the Census Bureau’s choice of treating race separately from ethnicity. This means that Hispanic is separated from the standard race categories. Additionally, the preliminary estimates do not include voting age population. As such, we build additional data using the blockpop package (McCartan 2021), which uses the FCC’s yearly block estimates of populations to estimate the 2020 population at the block level. This is fairly consistent and provides cleaner categories for 2020, but differs slightly from Colorado’s choice of population estimates.\nAs for election data, we rely on the precinct data from the Voting and Election Science Team, who produce some of the best redistricting data available. We average the Republican votes and Democratic votes across offices for 2016 by precinct across president and senate races (Voting and Team 2018). We do the same across the elections for Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of State elections in 2018 (Voting and Team 2019). To match the demographic data, we project this data down to blocks, splitting it by the proportion of voting age population in each precinct.\nWith all of this data estimated at the 2010 Census block level, we aggregate to 2020 voting districts. Using the 2020 Census’s shapefiles, we can then approximate the redistricting process in Colorado. This gives us 3108 geographic units, which average 1,618 people per voting district under the 2010 data, 1860 people under the data from blockpop, and 1858 under the preliminary data from Colorado.\nFinally, Colorado provides the district shapefiles, but doesn’t provide a block assignment file (BAF), which would match blocks to districts directly. Without this, we match blocks to districts by the area overlap of each voting district with the districts. Matching by area is imperfect, but this gives us a good starting point to consider the preliminary plan on 2020 geographies.\n\n\n\nKenny, Christopher T. 2021. “geomander: Geographic Tools for Studying Gerrymandering.” Available at The Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=geomander.\n\n\nMcCartan, Cory. 2021. “blockpop: Estimate Census Block Populations for 2020.” Available on GitHub. https://github.com/CoryMcCartan/blockpop.\n\n\nMcCartan, Cory, and Kosuke Imai. 2020. “Sequential Monte Carlo for Sampling Balanced and Compact Redistricting Plans.” arXiv Preprint arXiv:2008.06131.\n\n\nVoting, and Election Science Team. 2018. “2016 Precinct-Level Election Results.” Harvard Dataverse. https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/NH5S2I.\n\n\n———. 2019. “2018 Precinct-Level Election Results.” Harvard Dataverse. https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/UBKYRU.\n\n\n\n\n",
