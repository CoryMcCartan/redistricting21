# Analysis Scripts

Each analysis is contained in a named folder. The `template/` folder contains
template scripts for each analysis. Of the root-level scripts:

* `run.R` handles running the whole analysis and keeping components up-to-date.
* `analysis_helpers.R` has helper functions to automate common analyses and plots.
* `utils.R` contains shared utility scripts for data preparation, and also
handles development imports and template management.
